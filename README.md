# Secure Auth Backend

A production-style authentication system built with a **security-first mindset**, focusing on defending against common real-world web vulnerabilities.

## What Makes This Project Different?

This backend is not about “making login work” — it is about **making login secure**.

- JWT-based access control with protected routes   
- CSRF protection on sensitive endpoints   
- Strong password handling and validation  
- Input sanitization & strict error handling  

## Tech Stack

- Node.js & Express  
- MongoDB  
- JWT  
- Nodemailer (password reset flows)  
- Deployed on Render

## Implemented Security Controls

| Control | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| JWT Authentication | Prevents unauthorized API access |
| Input Validation | Stops injection attacks |
| Access Control | Ensures users only access their own data |

## Learning Outcomes

This project was built to deeply understand:

- Authentication bypass techniques  
- Token-based authorization flaws  
- Real-world API security risks  
- Defensive backend architecture
